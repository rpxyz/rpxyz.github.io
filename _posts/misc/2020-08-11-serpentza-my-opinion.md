Winston Sterzel otherwise known as SerpentZA is a South African vlogger who had since 2018 been living in Shenzhen, China and now known to be living in
Los Angeles, US due to him feeling unsafe in China. So where to start? lol, I have so much to talk about this guy I could go on for days and I am sure 
this is not going to be the only blog post I write about SerpentZA as he is still today posting YouTube videos about China.

So if you have read my <b>[about page](/about/)</b> you would know that I have been living in China for 15 years so I have my reasons behind me with what I write here. 

This post was inspired by the many comments I have made on other youtubers videos when they themselves were speaking about SerpentZA and so many of my
comments were voted up as I could speak outright facts about this guy. Facts that many of you would never know as maybe you have not met SerpentZA in person
or never actually visited China for you yourself to actually judge it. All things that I have done.

Did you know that actually at the beginning of SerpentZA's vlogging on YouTube it was actually decent content, it isn't like it is today where every 
video is hating on China, there is nothing positive at all anymore and this comes from the guy who claimed (he loves China).

<i>See the image below? that is pure hate! 24 videos of his recent activity (past 5 months) and every single one is negative about China and it's people!</i>

Let's not forget this guy isn't even in China anymore so it makes you wonder where he is getting all this bullshit from, this guy does however have an audience 
to cater for and that is the sad part! SerpentZA currently has 1,715 patrons and a strong following who still believe what he is saying is true.

Going over one of the videos he has recently posted, such as "<b>[How Chinese Prostitution works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fv65XKaPVk)</b>". This one right from the start makes me laugh, because
back in 2016 I clearly remember in one of his videos "<b>[Are Chinese Girls Easy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So0wXRR8BYU)</b>" SerpentZA states (he isn't a playboy and he detests those kind of people) so my
question here is, how does he know so much about how prostitution works? lol. Please don't say "his wife is Chinese" because MY girlfriend is Chinese too and
I have no idea how the prostitution here works and I have been here longer lol.

Anyway back onto the topic, what makes me dislike SerpentZA so much? well like I said, at the beginning his videos were pretty much like any others youtubers
vlogs, food, motors, travel, girls you name it, though it was all non-biased! from the eyes of a real vlogger who told the world about his everyday life.
So what happened? Well I can not answer that, only assume... You would need to ask SerpentZA himself for that answer. My assumption would be that he seen big 
money in what the world wanted, especially in a country which doesn't exactly have a good reputation in the west, and that was hate and pointing the finger! 
I mean come on, the BBC, CNN, all them big media outlets do it! and why? because it makes money and brings in the views! exactly what SerpentZA saw.

In one my most popular comments on a video by the vloggers "<b>[Barret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So0wXRR8BYU)</b>" in which that video itself is an opinion against SerpentZA I tried to give my view on 
things and that was one reason for this post too, as I always feel a comment can only give 1% of what I actually want to say, like I said further up I really
do have so much to add to all of this SerpentZA topic I am sure I will post more in the future. Bascially a lot of what I said there is here too, but with a lot
more detail to it. I think what would be a good idea is that I go through his videos and reply to it with my own opinion and facts.

China isn't perfect and neither is any other country, but it is no way as bad as SerpentZA makes it out to be, You can clearly see on YouTube that a LOT of 
China vloggers have spoken out against him, especially as he did stab many of us foreigners in the back with his anti-foreigner videos against us all though 
making himself seem special. Have you not noticed how normal China vloggers do not have the hundreds of thousands of fans as SerpentZA does? he has almost 1 
million fans! my point in this is how YouTube works, example - good videos about China, get missed! hate against China and it gets recommended! that is a fact
and everyone knows that negativity sells more! it's pretty sick how YouTube works but its true.

What gets me about SerpentZA is that China made him what he is today! popular, rich, married, regular income - all whilst he sold out China!
